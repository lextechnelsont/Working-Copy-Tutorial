# Working-Copy-Tutorial
THIS IS THE mac-sp-2 branch

A test of Working Copy with Swift Playground

What, deleted?
What Restored?

What's going on?

OK, we want to make sure things sync up first. So the rule is.

1. Wait to see the change
2. Close the file in Swift
3. If delay is slow, touch the file
4. Yes, doing stuff in Swift Playground doesn't look like it saves
5. Looks like you have to wait a while for content to change
6. Sometimes up to a min or 2
