# Working-Copy-Tutorial
THIS IS THE mac-sp-2 branch

A test of Working Copy with Swift Playground

What, deleted?
What Restored?

What's going on?

OK, we want to make sure things sync up first. So the rule is.

1. Wait to see the change
2. Close the file in Swift
3. If delay is slow, touch the file
4. Yes, doing stuff in Swift Playground doesn't look like it saves
5. Looks like you have to wait a while for content to change
6. Sometimes up to a min or 2

Test 2 if you nuke file bad things happen, but you can recover with creating new file and merging

Push test - Troubleshooting - if Codex file not found add new swift file, then delete if it resolves issue 


Syncs between multiple devices

ADD TO DRIVE
1. It's better to open via files vs. Playground
2. If it's asking for different versions generally you want to save the latest version (which should be up to date). But ONLY do this if you are sure you won't break Git.
